dotfiles
========

Basic dotfiles I often use on my Mac systems
I use Hack NerdFont as default font on my terminal emulators

## Shell & Zsh
* Jump to dir in history (fasd/autojump) : j <search string>
* Use <CTRL+R> for fuzzy zsh history search
* Use <CTRL+T> for fuzzy find in directories / files

## Git Cheatsheet
* Word diff : git diff --color-words=.
